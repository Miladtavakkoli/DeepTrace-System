# DeepTrace System Architecture
Medical-grade, traceable dialysis data processing system with AI-assisted advisory layers

---

## Project Status
🚧 **In Progress**  
Current implementation covers approximately **15–20%** of the full system design.

This repository documents the **system architecture, design philosophy, trust boundaries, and roadmap** of the DeepTrace platform.  
It intentionally focuses on **architecture and authority separation**, not on presenting a finished product.

---

## System Purpose

DeepTrace is a medical-grade system designed to process and visualize operational data generated by dialysis machines in a **deterministic, traceable, and audit-ready** manner.

The system is intended to support technicians and operators by:
- providing transparent operational insight,
- enforcing strict data integrity rules,
- and enabling AI-assisted observations **without clinical decision authority**.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
All authoritative data originates from **dialysis machine databases (SQLite)**.  
No component is allowed to fabricate, infer, or overwrite machine data.

### 2. Deterministic Processing
Given identical inputs, the system always produces identical outputs.  
No stochastic, non-repeatable, or opaque logic is permitted in core processing.

### 3. Full Traceability
Every displayed value, metric, or suggestion must be traceable back to:
- a specific machine,
- a specific session,
- and the original database records.

### 4. Strict Authority Separation
The system enforces clear trust zones:

- **Device Trust Zone**  
  Dialysis machines and their internal databases (source of truth)

- **Processing Trust Zone**  
  Backend authority responsible for validation, detection, aggregation, and report generation

- **Presentation Trust Zone**  
  UI and APIs operating in display-only mode with no data modification privileges

---

## High-Level Architecture

The system is composed of the following logical layers:

### Device Layer
- Dialysis machines generate operational and session data
- Databases are transferred offline (secure copy, no modification)

### Processing Authority Layer
Responsible for:
- Session detection
- Error and fail detection
- Validation rules enforcement
- Structured report generation

This layer represents the **only decision authority** in the system.

### Audit & Report Storage
- Stores generated reports
- Maintains trace metadata
- Preserves source mappings for auditability

### API & Distribution Layer
- REST API and WebSocket streams
- Read-only data exposure
- No business logic

### Presentation Layer (UI)
- Dashboard and visualization
- Session timelines and error charts
- Display-only enforcement

---

## AI Advisory Module (Non-Clinical)

The architecture includes an **AI advisory module** designed strictly for:

- pattern observation,
- trend highlighting,
- operational risk suggestions.

### AI Constraints
The AI module:
- operates only on **read-only datasets**,
- has **zero decision authority**,
- cannot modify data, reports, or system behavior,
- does **not** perform clinical reasoning or diagnosis.

AI output is treated as **optional insight**, never as truth.

---

## Safety & Medical-Grade Positioning

DeepTrace is **not a clinical decision system**.

It does **not**:
- recommend treatments,
- diagnose conditions,
- influence machine operation,
- or replace human or device authority.

The system is designed for **monitoring, auditing, and operational transparency** only.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository focuses on:
- system architecture documentation,
- trust boundary definition,
- AI positioning and constraints,
- and long-term roadmap planning.

Core implementation code is intentionally partial and evolving, reflecting the current development stage.

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- Solidify processing authority contracts
- Expand audit and trace validation mechanisms
- Implement UI display-only enforcement
- Gradual integration of constrained AI advisory features
- Progressive coverage toward full system implementation
